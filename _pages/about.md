Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Isaac, a `linguistics` researcher, a `Cog. Sc.` student, and an `NLP` novice. This June I'll graduate with a BA in Russian from [Shanghai International Studies University](https://en.shisu.edu.cn/) and will move to Ottawa to attend [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/) for grad school. I will be joining the [L-Neuro Lab](https://www.olessiajouravlev.com/) and the [ANIMUS Lab](https://carleton.ca/animus/) with Dr. Jouravlev and Dr. Kelly as my supervisors.

I'm generally interested in empirical and computational studies of diversity in languages. In terms of `language and social diversity`, I study the discursive construction of identities, ideologies, and biases. This interest was formulated through my first ever research project which ethnographically investigated language shift within the Ukrainian diaspora in Shanghai following the 2022 Russian invasion. In terms of `diversity across language structures`, I am interested in how the universalities and language contingencies interact in multilingual minds. My undergrad thesis quantitatively compared diachronic Dependency Distance Minimization in Russian and English, revealing how cross-linguistic properties may influence the cognitive constraints during syntactic processing.

Meanwhile, I am curious about how my research may be put into practice to tackle real-life technical issues. This is why I've been actively learning `Data Science and NLP`. I am currently working on a new project that adopts ML methods to untangle the biases embedded in Shanghai new media targeted at local transnational workers. I wish to build upon this project and examine how the dynamic nature of discursive practice, interpersonal interaction, and commonsense reasoning may be modeled or processed by NLP systems, and how this process can form a better understanding of the linguistic structure itself.

I seek topics that couple the acuteness of humanities and the pragmatism of engineering. What linguistic diversity tells us about the human mind and how this can inspire well-rounded, ethical machine intelligence will be at the center of my exploration during M. Cog. Sc.
