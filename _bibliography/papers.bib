 abstract = {This article reports on a study of multilingualism, language choice, and identity construction for six Ukrainians in Shanghai, China. Thematic analysis of data collected from netnographic observation, semi-structured interviews, and narrative frame writing revealed that diasporic Ukrainians’ language choice is both instrumentally strategic and sociopolitically charged; in the public domain, they construct light “citizen of the world” and “nice foreigner” identities; in the private domain, they construct “Ukrainian who speaks Ukrainian language” identity. To understand the seemingly binary or even conflicted situation, we turn to the concept of “social anchoring” and propose a conceptualization of “diasporic people's language choice and identity selection.” This study shows that the construction of diasporic identity is, first of all, an individualistic process, articulating the affective aspect in their seeking psychological stability; it is also a social practice indicating diasporic people's strategies in seeking social stability.},
